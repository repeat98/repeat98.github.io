          This tool is an independent project created out of a passion for vinyl
          records. It is not intended to replace Discogs but to serve as a
          complementary interface that offers a streamlined way to browse
          releases.
        </p>
        <p>
          This service is completely free and does not aim to compete with or
          duplicate Discogs. The goal is to provide a brief overview of records,
          making it easier to navigate through releases. Please note that not
          all tracks or videos are linked, as the focus is on offering a simple
          and efficient browsing experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Discogs or its representatives wish for this website to be taken
          down, please reach out via email:
          <a href="mailto:jannik.assfalg@gmail.com">jannik.assfalg@gmail.com</a
          >. I respect the work that has gone into building Discogs and am happy
          to discuss any concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project exists because I love vinyl, music, and discovering new
          sounds. Thank you to Discogs for being an invaluable resource for
          music lovers worldwide.
        </p>
